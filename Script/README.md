# CWWTechAfrica-Bootcamp-Individual-Project

This project was carried out by DAVID TOYOSI SADO during the first week of the bootcamp.

The project focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing, as well as data exploration and visualization:



Project Title: Customer Churn Analysis


Project Overview: 

In this project, you will work with a real-world data set from a telecom company that includes customer information, such as demographics, usage patterns, and whether they churned (i.e.,left thecompany) or not. The goal is to prepare the data for analysis, explore key pattern sand trends, and create visualizations to gain insights into factors influencing customer churn.


Project Objectives: 

1. Clean and preprocess the raw data set to make it suitable for analysis.
2. Explore the data set to understand the distribution of key variables.
3. Identify factors that may be associated with customer churn.
4. Create informative visualizations to communicate findings effectively.


Project Tasks:


Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Days1-2):


1. Load the raw data set (e.g.,CSV format) into a data analysis environment (Python with Pandas).

2. Examine the data for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

3. Handle missing datat hrough techniques like imputation (e.g., mean, median) or removal of rows/columns.

4. Address duplicates, if any, and remove unnecessary columns.

5. Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding)for modeling purposes.

6. Normalize or scale numeric features if needed.


Data Exploration (Days3-4):


7. Perform descriptive statistics to summarize the data set(e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).

8. Explore the distribution of key variables, such as customer demographics (age, gender), usage patterns (monthly charges,total charges),and churn status.

9. Calculateandvisualizecorrelationsbetweenvariables(e.g.,usingaheatmap).

10. Conduct hypothesis tests (e.g.,t-tests) to compare differences between churned and non-churned customers.

11. Create summary tables and statistics for various customer segments (e.g.,by contract type, payment method).


Data Visualization (Days5-6):


12. Generate insightful visualizations to communicate findings, including:

-Bar plots and histograms to show distribution of categorical and numeric variables. 

-Box plots to identify outliers.

-Scatternplots to explore relationships between numeric variables.

-Pie charts to visualize the proportion of churned vs. non-churned customers.

-Time series plots (if applicable) to observe trends over time.



13. Use Seaborn, Matplotlib,or other visualization libraries to enhance the aesthetics and clarity of plots.

14. Provide captions and labels for each visualization to make them self-explanatory.

15. Summarize key insights and findings from the visualizations.


Project Deliverables:

1. A clean and well-preprocessed data set ready for analysis.

2. An exploratory data analysis(EDA) report orJupyter Notebook documenting the data cleaning steps,exploratory analysis, and visualizations.

3. Interactive visualizations (if possible) that allow users to explore the data. 4.A presentation summarizing the project's findings, including insights into factors influencing customer churn.

Project Evaluation:

You will be evaluated based on the quality of your cleaned data set, the depth o your exploratory   analysis, and the effectiveness of your visualizations in communicating insights. Additionally, your ability to present and explainy our findings will be assessed.

This project not only reinforces the skills of data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis but also provides valuable insights for business decision-making regarding customer churn mitigation strategies.
